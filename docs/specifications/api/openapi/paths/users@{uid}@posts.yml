    Retrieves a paginated list of blog posts owned by the specified user (identified by Firebase `uid`).

    Requires Firebase Authentication. The caller must be the same user as `{uid}` or have admin permissions.

    Supports filtering by `status`. When `status` is omitted, returns all posts for the user
    (both `published` and `draft`).

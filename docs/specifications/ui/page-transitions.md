# Page Transition Specification

This document outlines the standards and patterns for page transitions within the application. Consistent and smooth transitions are crucial for a good user experience, providing visual feedback and a sense of place.

## General Principles

- **Consistency**: Transitions should be consistent across the application. Similar actions should result in similar transitions.
- **Performance**: Animations should be smooth and performant, primarily using CSS transforms (`translate`, `opacity`, `scale`) to avoid layout recalculations.
- **Clarity**: Transitions should clarify the relationship between pages and user actions, not distract or confuse the user.

## Main Application Flow

The following diagram illustrates the primary navigation paths between the main pages of the application.

```mermaid

    direction LR

    [*] --> HomePage

    state "Blog Content" as Content {
        HomePage: List of posts
        PostDetailPage: Single post view
    }

    state "Blog Management" as Management {
        CreatePostPage: New post form
        EditPostPage: Edit post form
    }

    HomePage --> PostDetailPage: Clicks a post
    PostDetailPage --> HomePage: Navigates back

    HomePage --> CreatePostPage: Clicks "Create Post"
    PostDetailPage --> EditPostPage: Clicks "Edit"

    CreatePostPage --> HomePage: Post submitted
    EditPostPage --> PostDetailPage: Post updated

    CreatePostPage --> HomePage: Action cancelled
    EditPostPage --> PostDetailPage: Action cancelled
```

## Transition Animation Details

### 1. Standard Navigational Transition

This transition is used for navigating between primary pages at the same hierarchical level, such as moving from the `HomePage` to the `PostDetailPage`.

- **Description**: The new page slides in from the right, covering the old page. When navigating back, the old page slides out to the right, revealing the previous page.
- **Use Cases**: 
    - `HomePage` -> `PostDetailPage`
    - `PostDetailPage` -> `EditPostPage`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant OldPage
    participant NewPage

    Note over OldPage, NewPage: User clicks a navigation link

    OldPage->>NewPage: Animate Out (Slide Left)
    activate OldPage
    Note right of OldPage: opacity: 1 -> 0<br/>transform: translateX(0) -> translateX(-25%)
    deactivate OldPage

    NewPage->>OldPage: Animate In (Slide From Right)
    activate NewPage
    Note left of NewPage: opacity: 0 -> 1<br/>transform: translateX(100%) -> translateX(0)
    deactivate NewPage
```

### 2. Form Submission & Data Operations

This indicates that the application is processing a user request, like submitting a form or saving data.

- **Description**: The button that triggered the action will display a loading spinner. The form fields will be disabled to prevent further input. Upon completion, a success or error message may be displayed before transitioning to the next page.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant Server

    User->>UI: Clicks "Publish" button
    UI->>UI: Disable form fields & show spinner on button
    UI->>Server: POST /api/posts
    activate Server
    Server-->>UI: Respond with success/error
    deactivate Server
    UI->>UI: Re-enable form & hide spinner
    alt On Success
        UI->>UI: Show success notification
        UI->>UI: Transition to new page (e.g., PostDetailPage)
    else On Error
        UI->>UI: Show error message
    end
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Library**: It is recommended to use a dedicated animation library like `framer-motion` to handle these transitions in a declarative way.
- **CSS**: Define transition properties and animations in the global CSS file to ensure consistency and reusability.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that animations do not negatively impact users with motion sensitivity. A `prefers-reduced-motion` media query should be used to disable or simplify animations for these users.

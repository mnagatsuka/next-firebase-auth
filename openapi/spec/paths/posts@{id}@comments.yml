  summary: Create Comment
  description: |
    Creates a new comment on a specific blog post. Requires authentication.
    
    **Response Pattern:**
    - HTTP Response: Acknowledgment response only (no comment data)
    - WebSocket Broadcast: New comment data is broadcast to all connected clients via API Gateway WebSocket
    
    **WebSocket Message Format (sent to all clients after successful creation):**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "NEW_COMMENT",
      "postId": "string",
      "comment": {
        "id": "string",
        "content": "string",
        "authorId": "string", 
        "authorName": "string",
        "createdAt": "timestamp"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The userId will be automatically set based on the authenticated user's Firebase UID.
    Comments are moderated and may not appear immediately.
